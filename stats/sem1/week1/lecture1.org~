* Basic Definations

** Major Branches of Statistics
1. Description : The branch of statistics that is concerened with describing and summarization of data is known as descriptive statistics.
2. Inference   : The branch of statistics that deals with drawing conclusions from the given data set is known as inferential statistics.

* Population and Sample
1. Population : The set of all elements that we're interested in is called population.
2. Sample : A subgroup of population that will be studied in detail is called a sample. A good sample needs to be representative
of the population.

For example:
    - If we want to know the percentage of students in India who have passed class 12th and are studying engineering.
      - **Population** -> The total students in India.
      - **Sample** -> The total number of engineering students in India.

* Purpose of Statistical Analysis
- If the purpose of the analysis is to examine and explore information for its own intrinsic interest only, the study is descriptive.
- A descriptve study may be done on a population or a sample.
- If the purpose of the analysis is to draw conclusion from a sample of a population about the population itself, the study is inferential.
- When an inference is made on a population based on information gathered from a sample, then the study becomes inferential.
